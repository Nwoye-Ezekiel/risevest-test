# Project overwiew

Rise Vest gave me this project as part of their screening process as a frontend coding exam. With the Figma design URL provided, I developed the RiseVest landing page. I made every effort to ensure that the implementation was as pixel-perfect as possible. It has animations, is mobile and desktop responsive, and has a functional mobile navigation menu, among other things. It was an intriguing experience for me because I had to push myself to produce outstanding work while also meeting the deadline.
