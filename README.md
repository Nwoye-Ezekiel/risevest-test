# Project overwiew

This is a technical assessment by Risevest which is to implement the landing page of the company. I ensured that the implementation was as pixel-perfect as possible. It has animations, is mobile and desktop responsive, and has a functional mobile navigation menu, among other things. It was an intriguing experience for me because I had to push myself to produce an outstanding work while also meeting the deadline.
